Scoring Pipeline Deployment Examples
====================================

Driverless AI scoring pipelines can be deployed independently of the machine
where Driverless AI is running. This essentially helps you to separate the 
concerns of Model Training from Model Deployment. This capability gives you
immense flexibility on how you can deploy your scoring pipelines to production.

This directory list contains example code that will show how to deploy DAI 
scoring pipelines (python and mojo) on new machines.

Refer to `python` and `java` directories for detailed examples on how to deploy
the corresponding pipeline in various scenarios.
