Scoring Pipeline Deployment Examples
====================================

Driverless AI scoring pipelines can be deployed independently of the machine
where Driverless AI is running. This essentially helps you to separate the 
concerns of Model Training from Model Deployment. This capability gives you
immense flexibility on how you can deploy your scoring pipelines to production.

This directory list contains example code that will show how to deploy DAI 
scoring pipelines (python and mojo) on new machines.

Refer to `python` and `java` directories for detailed examples on how to deploy
the corresponding pipeline in various scenarios.


Disclaimer
----------

The scoring pipeline wrapper code shared in this directory is created to provide you 
a sample starting point and is not intended to be directly deployed to production as is.
You can use this starting point and build over it to solve your deployment needs ensuring
that your security etc. requirements are met.
